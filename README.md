# hertie-rct

Here are our ideas for the RCT trial so far...

(I copied this table from the [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14MA3Byrm7Y5kIvQcWY170nYGoM0OXP1gxkfz-n_SJiQ/edit) using [this](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables))

We can collaboratively edit stuff with GitHub and use issues to communicate.

| Idea | Description / Research Q / Motivation | Observation Group | Treatment Selection | Treatment | Measured Behaviour | Challenges / Unintended Consequences? |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Takeaway cup awareness | Does forcing people to record (undesirable) behaviour, and to see that individual behaviour as part of the cumulative effect of that behaviour in a community help them to reduce it? | Customers of the School (any other that we can find?) Cafeteria | Different weeks | Customers using a takeaway cup have to record that cup to the daily tally on a blackboard by the counter (level equivalents - e.g. 10 cups = 100g CO2 or whatever could be indicated) | Number of takeaway cups consumed / percentage of coffees that are takeaway | More china cups used and then get broken or lost? |
| Something with Twitter | Can exposing groups of social media users to opposing opinions permanently broaden their network (to include opposing views) / change their opinions | Followers of one (or both) sides of an issue (e.g UKIP supporters / vote leave EU followers / whatever) | Observation group randomly assigned to Tweetment (haha) or control group | Expose users to opposing side (e.g. vote stay in) or (curated by us) opposing views by retweeting | Survey opinion on issue before and after or measure changes in following opposing views | Behaviour change? True opinion change? |
| Thermostat Defaults | Does setting a thermostat to a low level at the beginning of the day affect the setting at later points in the day? | Selected Hertie classroom thermostats | Random split of classrooms | Go round at the beginning of the day and set the thermostat to a low level | Thermostat setting at later point(s) in the day | Cold students? |
| Classroom Data Monitoring | Does telling students that the amount of data used in a classroom is being monitored reduce the amount they mess around on their phone in class? | Selected Hertie Classes | Random split of classes | Tell students in a class that for the duration of the class, the amount of data that goes through the router in the room will be monitored | Amount of data downloaded in each classroom during each class | Switch to 3G? Tell other students about it? |
